# New Years Resolution: No Cake

## Status
<!-- What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->
Proposed

## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
I've been gaining weight throughout the last year and have become addicted to chocolate cake in particular. 

I'm starting to feel tired more often too.

I have clothing that is getting really tight and now it's costing me money because I have to purchase new clothing.

So, overall concerns are:
- Loosing Money
- Lack of discipline
- Lack of energy

## Decision
<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
No more cake of any kind for the next year. 

## Consequences
<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->
- If I gain more discipline in this area, then I may be more confident about being disciplined in other areas of my life.
- This could lead to replacing cake with something else like chocolate mouse. Will need to be aware of this temptation as I moved forward with this decision.
