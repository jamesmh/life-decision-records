# Buy A Poodle

## Status
<!-- What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->
Proposed

## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
I've been lonely lately, especially given all the lock-downs and restrictions during COVID-19.

I like cats but dogs are more fun. Dog poo doesn't stink as much too.

Some options include:

- German Shephard: Fun but too big.
- Poodle: Fun and a nice size (not too big, not too small)

## Decision
<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
I've decided to buy a poodle.

## Consequences
<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->
- I'll have to schedule time in my days now to bring the dog for a walk
- Extra budget for dog food, accessories and medical needs
