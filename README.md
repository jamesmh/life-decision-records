# Life Decision Records

[ADRs](https://adr.github.io/) (Architectural Decision Records) are a way of documenting important choices that are made within the design and development of a software system.
Each record represents a decision that was considered and can have a status of proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.

For example, when deciding that a software system wants to start using a new technology within their development, they would create an ADR documenting the context around the decision and why (or why not) a particular decision was made.

ADRs, once proposed, are reviewed using a pull-request so that other team members and stakeholders agree/disagree with the decision in question and can communicate with the author about missing elements of the decision or pieces of the decision they don't understand.

As a software engineer, I thought:

> What if we used ADRs for important life decisions and use pull-requests to get feedback from friends and close advisors?

You could also document your important decisions and keep this collection of records as a way of looking back on your past year(s).

This is a kind of tongue-in-cheek idea - but perhaps someone would legit find this useful!

Take a look under the "records" folder for a couple of a examples of how you could create these ðŸš€.
