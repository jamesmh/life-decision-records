# Life Decision Records

[ADRs](https://adr.github.io/) (Architectural Decision Records) are a way of documenting important choices that are made within the design and development of a software system.
Each record represents a decision that was considered and can have a status of proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.

For example, when deciding that a software team wants to introduce a new technology within their stack, they would create an ADR documenting the context around the decision and why (or why not) a particular decision was made.

Once proposed, ADRs are reviewed using a pull-request so that other team members and stakeholders can interact with the decision in question. They can communicate with the author about missing elements of the decision or pieces they don't understand.

As a software engineer, I thought:

> What if we created ADRs for important life decisions and use pull-requests to get feedback from friends and close advisors?

You could also document your important decisions and keep this collection of records as a way of looking back on your past year(s).

This is a kind of tongue-in-cheek idea - but perhaps someone would legit find this useful!

Take a look under the "records" folder for a couple of a examples of how you could create these ðŸš€.
